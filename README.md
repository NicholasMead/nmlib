# nmlib
==============

A collection of headers and librarys that I have created for streamling my own workflow.

The file in this git are created for my own personal use. You may use them if you wish, but be reminded that they are taylored to my personal needs and come with no guarantee or liability.

It is not my fault if you use these file and accidently end the world.

## To Install 

1. Download and navigate to the downloaded folder withing your Lunix or OSX bash terminal.
2. Type ```$ make``` or ```$ make OS=OSX``` if you are a Mac user. This Builds the library files.
3. Type ```$ make PREFIX=[DIR]```, prelaceing ```[DIR]``` as required, to install to a specific location. 
  * Mac users still require the `OS_OSX` argument.
4. Append your `.bashrc` or `.profile` file with `source [DIR]/nmlibs/bin/this-nmlibs.sh`and reload your terminal (or run your `.bashrc` or `.profile` file).
5. Enjoy, and dont forget the fork me on github to show your apperisiation.
